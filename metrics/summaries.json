Additionally, there are shared data model and shared code components used at build time for creating Docker images.

It also handles LDAP connections and user authentication, configuration settings, and importing example reports. The collector component collects measurement data from sources at regular intervals, while the notifier component is responsible for notifying users about significant events. The shared code component contains code and resources shared between servers and the collector and notifier components. The data model allows for the specification and management of metrics, sources, and parameters, while also defining and managing measurement entities and their attributes. The component also includes a flexible and customizable data table, a `subjects` data model, a `proxy` for routing traffic, a MongoDB database, and a renderer component for converting quality reports to PDF files.
