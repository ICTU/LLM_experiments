def unit_test_prompt(codefiles, functionality):

Your task is to generate unit tests for a codebase in order to ensure the correctness and robustness of a specific functionality. 

You will receive the content of the codebase as a dictionary where the keys are the filepaths and the values are the content of the files. Here are the relevant files from the codebase:

<codefiles>
{codefiles}
</codefiles>

The specific functionality you should focus on when writing tests is:
{functionality}

First, carefully analyze the provided codefiles and identify the key components, functions, and classes that are directly related to implementing the specified functionality. 

Next, come up with a list of potential edge cases, failure scenarios, and unexpected inputs that could occur when using this functionality. Think about how the code should handle these situations.

Then, write a comprehensive set of unit tests in the same programming language as the codebase. These tests should cover the core components you identified, as well as the edge cases and failure scenarios you brainstormed. Make sure your tests are thorough and cover as many potential issues as possible. The goal is to catch any bugs or unintended behavior related to the specified functionality.

Provide ONLY the full code for your generated unit tests. Do not include any other explanations, brainstorming, or text. The code should be directly usable in a script.

Remember, your tests should be focused specifically on {functionality}. Do not worry about testing unrelated parts of the codebase. The key is to write targeted, effective tests that will ensure this key functionality is robust and works as intended, even in unexpected situations.
